# üìä ML-Based E-Commerce Recommendation Engine ‚Äî Machine Learning Project

---

## üìù Problem Statement

In the competitive landscape of e-commerce, understanding user behavior and predicting purchase intent is crucial for improving customer experience and driving sales. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a user will purchase a product based on various user attributes, product details, and interaction features.

By accurately predicting purchase behavior, the model aims to:

- Help businesses personalize recommendations.
- Optimize marketing strategies by identifying potential buyers.
- Improve inventory management by forecasting product demand.
- Enhance customer retention efforts by targeting users likely to make a purchase.

The solution leverages a dataset containing 60,000 records and 50+ features, ensuring comprehensive analysis and model development.

## üîÑ Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Initial Exploration

- Loaded the dataset containing 60,000 records and 50+ features related to users, products, and interactions.
- Conducted initial inspection to understand the data structure, feature types, and data distribution.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values appropriately using imputation or removal depending on feature importance.
- Checked and removed duplicates or irrelevant records if any.
- Identified and treated outliers using suitable techniques like the IQR method.
- Standardized column names and formats for consistency.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed distributions of numerical and categorical features to understand user behavior and product performance.
- Visualized correlations between features and the target variable (purchase behavior).
- Identified patterns in user demographics, product categories, interaction frequency, and session behaviors that may influence purchase intent.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

- Created new features such as interaction rates, time spent on product pages, user activity scores, or recency-frequency metrics.
- Transformed skewed features to normalize distributions.
- Encoded categorical variables using appropriate encoding methods (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
- Performed feature scaling using StandardScaler or PowerTransformer to normalize numerical variables.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Class Imbalance

- Checked for class imbalance in the target variable (purchase vs. no purchase).
- Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset and improve model generalization.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection

- Used correlation analysis and feature importance scores to select the most relevant predictors.
- Removed redundant or irrelevant features to avoid overfitting and improve model efficiency.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development

- Trained multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier.
- Split the data into training and testing sets to validate model performance.
- Compared models based on multiple evaluation metrics.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning

- Applied GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters for Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Selected the model with the best performance after tuning.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

- Evaluated models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC score.
- Analyzed confusion matrices to assess model performance on both classes.

### üîü Business Insights & Recommendations

- Identified key drivers of purchase behavior including user engagement, product attributes, and interaction features.
- Provided actionable insights for personalizing recommendations, targeting potential buyers, and optimizing inventory management.
- Demonstrated how businesses can leverage predictive analytics to improve marketing strategies and enhance customer retention.
